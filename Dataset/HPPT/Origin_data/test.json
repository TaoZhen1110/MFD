However, existing works are unable to support database queries, such as “List/Count all female athletes who were born in 20th century”, which require reasoning over sets of relevant facts with operations such as join, filtering and aggregation. We show that while state-of-the-art transformer models perform very well for small databases, they exhibit limitations in processing noisy data, numerical operations, and queries that aggregate facts. We propose a modular architecture to answer these database-style queries over multiple spans from text and aggregating these at scale. We evaluate the architecture using WikiNLDB, a novel dataset for exploring such queries. Our architecture scales to databases containing thousands of facts whereas contemporary models are limited by how many facts can be encoded. In direct comparison on small databases, our approach increases overall answer accuracy from 85% to 90%. On larger databases, our approach retains its accuracy whereas transformer baselines could not encode the context.",

Recently, Hou (2018) created word embeddings (embeddings_PP) to capture associative similarity (i.e., relatedness) between nouns by exploring the syntactic structure of noun phrases. But embeddings_PP only contains word representations for nouns. In this paper, we create new word vectors by combining embeddings_PP with GloVe. This new word embeddings (embeddings_bridging) are a more general lexical knowledge resource for bridging and allow us to represent the meaning of an NP beyond its head easily. We therefore develop a deterministic approach for bridging anaphora resolution, which represents the semantics of an NP based on its head noun and modifications. We show that this simple approach achieves the competitive results compared to the best system in Hou et al. (2013) which explores Markov Logic Networks to model the problem.

The approach is based on a generative Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that models object relations/attributes of the world as latent variables. The CVAE jointly learns a performer that predicts actions and an explainer that gathers commonsense evidence to justify the action. Our results show that compared to a traditional attention-based model, CVAE performs significantly better in both action prediction and justification. Additionally, a human subject study demonstrates that the commonsense evidence gathered by CVAE can effectively communicate with humans, leading to a higher level of common ground between humans and agents.",

Furthermore, based on our findings, we propose a simple yet effective method to generate synthetic data to better trade off both factors so as to yield the better performance for BT. We run extensive experiments on WMT14 DE-EN, EN-DE, and RU-EN benchmark tasks. By employing our proposed method to generate synthetic data, our BT model significantly outperforms the standard BT baselines (i.e., beam and sampling based methods for data generation), which proves the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",

Our approach involves jointly pruning coarse-grained modules, such as layers, and fine-grained modules, such as heads and hidden units, using masks of different granularities to control the pruning of each parameter. Additionally, we implement a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi results in models with over 10X speedups with only a small drop in accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches.",

Second, the extraction is entirely data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem. We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to perform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach, exploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and table relation embeddings. We consider text-to-table as an inverse problem of the well-studied table-to-text, and make use of four existing table-to-text datasets in our experiments on text-to-table. Experimental results show that the vanilla seq2seq model can outperform the baseline methods of using relation extraction and named entity extraction.

This work examines the computation of higher-order derivatives with respect to the normalization constant for weighted finite-state machines. We provide a general algorithm for evaluating derivatives of all orders, which has not been previously described in the literature. In the case of second-order derivatives, our scheme runs in the optimal O(A\\^2 N\\^4) time where A is the alphabet size and N is the number of states. Our algorithm is significantly faster than prior algorithms. Additionally, our approach leads to a significantly faster algorithm for computing second-order expectations, such as covariance matrices and gradients of first-order expectations.",

They initialize the deep classifier by training over labeled texts; and then alternatively predict unlabeled texts as their pseudo-labels and train the deep classifier over the mixture of labeled and pseudo-labeled texts. Naturally, their performance is largely affected by the accuracy of pseudo-labels for unlabeled texts. Unfortunately, they often suffer from low accuracy because of the margin bias problem caused by the large difference between representation distributions of labels in SSTC. To alleviate this problem, we apply the angular margin loss, and perform Gaussian linear transformation to achieve balanced label angle variances, i.e., the variance of label angles of texts within the same label. More accuracy of predicted pseudo-labels can be achieved by constraining all label angle variances balanced, where they are estimated over both labeled and pseudo-labeled texts during self-training loops. With this insight, we propose a novel SSTC method, namely Semi-Supervised Text Classification with Balanced Deep representation Distributions (S2TC-BDD). To evaluate S2TC-BDD, we compare it against the state-of-the-art SSTC methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of S2TC-BDD, especially when the labeled texts are scarce.",

One of the problematic presumptions with current MRC technologies is that each question is assumed to be answerable by looking at a given text passage. However, to realize human-like language comprehension ability, a machine should also be able to distinguish not-answerable questions (NAQs) from answerable questions. To develop this functionality, a dataset incorporating hard-to-detect NAQs is vital; however, its manual construction would be expensive. This paper proposes a dataset creation method that alters an existing MRC dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, and describes the resulting dataset. The value of this dataset is likely to increase if each NAQ in the dataset is properly classified with the difficulty of identifying it as an NAQ. This difficulty level would allow researchers to evaluate a machine's NAQ detection performance more precisely. Therefore, we propose a method for automatically assigning difficulty level labels, which measures the similarity between a question and the target text passage. Our NAQ detection experiments demonstrate that the resulting dataset, having difficulty level annotations, is valid and potentially useful in the development of advanced MRC models.",

To enhance the accessibility of this dataset, we have created a search engine and a command-line tool, and annotated the corpus with research topics, relevant resources, prerequisite relations among topics, and relevant sub-parts of individual resources, among other annotations. We are excited to release TutorialBank and present several avenues for further research.",

A common solution often resorts to sequence-level knowledge distillation by rebuilding the training dataset through autoregressive generation (hereinafter known as “teacher AG”).

However, in this work, we experimentally reveal that this assumption does not always hold for the text generation tasks like text summarization and story ending generation. To provide a feasible solution to the multimodality problem of NAG, we propose incorporating linguistic structure (Part-of-Speech sequence in particular) into NAG inference instead of relying on teacher AG. More specifically, the proposed POS-constrained Parallel Decoding (POSPD) method aims at providing a specific POS sequence to constrain the NAG model during decoding. Our experiments demonstrate that POSPD consistently improves NAG models on four text generation tasks to a greater extent compared to knowledge distillation.

In this study, we present a multi-stage action-based model that can perform morphological transformation and part-of-speech tagging using arbitrary units of input, applied to character-level Korean morphological analysis.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a “wayward” behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy). Based on these observations, we further propose simple and effective strategies, named in-domain pretraining and input adaptation to remedy the domain and objective discrepancies, respectively.

Most of PLMs follow the default setting of architecture hyper-parameters (e.g., the hidden dimension is a quarter of the intermediate dimension in feed-forward sub-networks) in BERT. Few studies have been conducted to explore the design of architecture hyper-parameters in BERT, especially for the more efficient PLMs with tiny sizes, which are essential for practical deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we adopt the one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically search architecture hyper-parameters. Specifically, we carefully design the techniques of one-shot learning and the search space to provide an adaptive and efficient development way of tiny PLMs for various latency constraints. We name our method AutoTinyBERT and evaluate its effectiveness on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. The extensive experiments show that our method outperforms both the SOTA search-based baseline (NAS-BERT) and the SOTA distillation-based methods (such as DistilBERT, TinyBERT, MiniLM, and MobileBERT). In addition, based on the obtained architectures, we propose a more efficient development method that is even faster than the development of a single PLM.

Our framework consists of two complementary curricula: corpus-level (CC) and instance-level (IC). CC focuses on gradually increasing the model's ability to find matching clues between the dialogue context and response candidate, while IC strengthens the model's ability to identify mismatching information. Our empirical studies on three benchmark datasets and three state-of-the-art matching models demonstrate that the proposed learning framework significantly improves model performance across various evaluation metrics.",

While the indirectness of figurative language warrants speakers to achieve certain pragmatic goals, it is challenging for AI agents to comprehend such idiosyncrasies of human communication. Though sarcasm identification has been a well-explored topic in dialogue analysis, for conversational systems to truly grasp a conversation's innate meaning and generate appropriate responses, simply detecting sarcasm is not enough; it is vital to explain its underlying sarcastic connotation to capture its true essence. In this work, we study the discourse structure of sarcastic conversations and propose a novel task – Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED). Set in a multimodal and code-mixed setting, the task aims to generate natural language explanations of satirical conversations. To this end, we curate WITS, a new dataset to support our task. We propose MAF (Modality Aware Fusion), a multimodal context-aware attention and global information fusion module to capture multimodality and use it to benchmark WITS. The proposed attention module surpasses the traditional multimodal fusion baselines and reports the best performance on almost all metrics.

Our solution involves transforming the output layer of an initial model trained on source data, allowing it to recognize new Named Entity (NE) categories in subsequent target data. The rest of the architecture remains unchanged, with parameters transferred from the initial model, and the network is fine-tuned on the target data. Our approach, based on sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models, is designed to perform better in the progressive setting, and we compare it to a Bidirectional LSTM, a strong neural NER model. Our experiments demonstrate that the Seq2Seq model performs well in the standard NER setting and is more robust in the progressive setting, enabling recognition of previously unseen NE categories while maintaining knowledge of seen data.",

In this paper, we follow Rutherford and Xue (2015) to expand the training data set using the corpus of explicitly-related arguments, by arbitrarily dropping the overtly presented discourse connectives. On the basis, we carry out an experiment of sampling, in which a simple active learning approach is used, so as to take the informative instances for data expansion. The goal is to verify whether the selective use of external data not only reduces the time consumption of retraining but also ensures a better system performance. Using the expanded training data, we retrain a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifer which is a simplified version of Qin et al. (2016)'s stacking gated relation recognizer. Experimental results show that expanding the training set with small-scale carefully-selected external data yields substantial performance gain, with the improvements of about 4% for accuracy and 3.6% for F-score.

Unlike previous work, it does not require syntactic information such as constituency parses or semantic information such as paraphrase pairs. Our model, called QKVAE, is based solely on the inductive bias found in attention-based architectures like Transformers. In Transformers, attention handles information selection and conveys what information is selected. QKVAE uses attention in its decoder to read latent variables, with one variable inferring keys and another inferring values. Our experiments on latent representations and syntax/semantics transfer show that QKVAE has clear signs of disentangled syntax and semantics. Additionally, our model displays competitive syntax transfer capabilities compared to supervised models, and comparable supervised models need a large amount of data (over 50K samples) to outperform it in both syntactic and semantic transfer.

First, we utilize cross-stitch mechanism to combine the different task-specific features selectively as the input to ensure proper two-way interactions.

However, despite recent promising results, our findings suggest that reference-free evaluation metrics for summarization and dialog generation may be relying on questionable correlations with measures such as word overlap, perplexity, and length. Furthermore, for text summarization, these metrics have high error rates when ranking the current state-of-the-art abstractive summarization systems. To address these errors, we propose explicitly designing evaluation metrics that avoid spurious features in reference-free evaluation.",

However, due to the unequal distribution of text resources on the web across different languages, it is common to have the tabular premise in a high-resource language and the hypothesis in a low-resource language. To address this issue, we introduce the challenging task of bilingual Tabular Natural Language Inference (bTNLI), where the tabular premise and hypothesis are in two different languages. We have created EI-InfoTabS, an English-Indic bTNLI dataset, by translating the hypotheses of the English TNLI dataset InfoTabS into 11 major Indian languages. Our study investigates how pre-trained multilingual models perform on EI-InfoTabS and shows that the performance on bTNLI can be comparable to its monolingual counterpart, with translate-train, translate-test, and unified-train being strong baselines.",

However, recent research suggests that data order can have a significant impact on the performance of finetuned models for natural language understanding. Hence, we examine the effect of a human-like easy-to-difficult curriculum during finetuning of language models for commonsense reasoning tasks. We use paced curriculum learning to rank data and sample training mini-batches with increasing levels of difficulty from the ranked dataset during finetuning. Further, we investigate the effect of an adaptive curriculum, i.e., the data ranking is dynamically updated during training based on the current state of the learner model. We use a teacher model to measure difficulty of each sample and experiment with three measures based on question answering probability, variability and out-of-distribution. To understand the effectiveness of curriculum learning in various scenarios, we apply it on full model fine-tuning as well as parameter-efficient prompt-tuning settings. Our results show that fixed as well as adaptive curriculum learning significantly improve performance for five commonsense reasoning tasks, i.e., SocialIQA, CosmosQA, CODAH, HellaSwag, WinoGrande in both tuning settings.

However, the post-processing of contextualized embeddings is an under-researched area. In this study, we examine the value of post-processing for contextualized embeddings obtained from different layers of pre-trained language models. Specifically, we standardize neuron activations by using z-score normalization, min-max normalization, and by removing the top principal components with the all-but-the-top method. We also apply unit length normalization to word representations. Our results demonstrate that post-processing reveals crucial information in the representations for both lexical tasks (such as word similarity and analogy) and sequence classification tasks. Our findings provide new insights into the use of contextualized representations and suggest that z-score normalization should be considered an important step when using them in applications.",

To this end, we systematically generate various types of `AddText' attacks for both token and sentence-level rationalization tasks and perform an extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art rationale models across five different tasks. Our experiments reveal that the rationale models promise to improve robustness over AddText attacks while they struggle in certain scenarios–when the rationalizer is sensitive to position bias or lexical choices of attack text.

In dialogues, it is intuitive that the most recent utterances are more important than the least recent ones, meaning time-aware attention should decay over time. This paper investigates various types of time-decay attention on the sentence-level and speaker-level, and proposes a flexible universal time-decay attention mechanism. The experiments on the benchmark Dialogue State Tracking Challenge (DSTC4) dataset show that the proposed time-decay attention mechanisms significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art contextual understanding model.",

Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been effective as an alternative for commonsense clues, but existing work relies on large-scale in-domain or out-of-domain labeled data or fails to generate high-quality knowledge in a general way. To address this, we propose the All-round Thinker (ArT) approach, which takes into account the association between knowledge during generation. Our model first focuses on key parts of the context and generates highly related knowledge based on association, mimicking human thinking. Additionally, for casual reasoning, we have added a reverse thinking mechanism to enhance bidirectional inferring between cause and effect. ArT is completely unsupervised and does not require KBs. We evaluate ArT on three commonsense QA benchmarks: COPA, SocialIQA, and SCT. Our results show that ArT outperforms previous advanced unsupervised models on all PLM backbones.",

In this paper, we explore the level dependency and path dependency of the label hierarchy in a generative way for building the knowledge of upper-level labels of current path into lower-level ones, and thus propose a novel PAAM-HiA-T5 model for HTC: a hierarchy-aware T5 model with path-adaptive attention mechanism.

To further improve label dependency prediction within each path, we then propose an original path-adaptive attention mechanism (PAAM) to lead the model to adaptively focus on the path where the currently generated label is located, shielding the noise from other paths.

Existing methods usually select reliable sentences that rely on potential noisy labels, resulting in wrongly selecting many noisy training instances or underutilizing a large amount of valuable training data. This paper proposes a sentence-level DSRE method beyond typical instance selection approaches by preventing samples from falling into the wrong classification space on the feature space. Specifically, a theorem for denoising and the corresponding implementation, named Consensus Enhanced Training Approach (CETA), are proposed in this paper. By training the model with CETA, samples of different classes are separated, and samples of the same class are closely clustered in the feature space. Thus the model can easily establish the robust classification boundary to prevent noisy labels from biasing wrongly labeled samples into the wrong classification space. This process is achieved by enhancing the classification consensus between two discrepant classifiers and does not depend on any potential noisy labels, thus avoiding the above two limitations.

In this work, we explore whether the UID hypothesis can be operationalized as an inductive bias for statistical language modeling. Specifically, we augment the canonical MLE objective for training language models with a regularizer that encodes UID. In experiments on ten languages spanning five language families, we find that using UID regularization consistently improves perplexity in language models, having a larger effect when training data is limited. Moreover, via an analysis of generated sequences, we find that UID-regularized language models have other desirable properties, e.g., they generate text that is more lexically diverse. Our results not only suggest that UID is a reasonable inductive bias for language modeling, but also provide an alternative validation of the UID hypothesis using modern-day NLP tools.",

However, there has been relatively less work on analyzing their ability to generate structured outputs such as graphs. Unlike natural language, graphs have distinct structural and semantic properties in the context of a downstream NLP task, e.g., generating a graph that is connected and acyclic can be attributed to its structural constraints, while the semantics of a graph can refer to how meaningfully an edge represents the relation between two node concepts. In this work, we study pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end manner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and semantics of such graphs. We first show that with limited supervision, pre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these constraints or are semantically incoherent. Since curating large amount of human-annotated graphs is expensive and tedious, we propose simple yet effective ways of graph perturbations via node and edge edit operations that lead to structurally and semantically positive and negative graphs. Next, we leverage these graphs in different contrastive learning models with Max-Margin and InfoNCE losses. Our methods lead to significant improvements in both structural and semantic accuracy of explanation graphs and also generalize to other similar graph generation tasks. Lastly, we show that human errors are the best negatives for contrastive learning and also that automatically generating more such human-like negative graphs can lead to further improvements.",

We show that pre-trained language models suffer from overgeneralization and tend to treat quantified generic statements such as “all ducks lay eggs” as if they were true generics. Furthermore, we demonstrate how knowledge embedding methods can lessen this effect by injecting factual knowledge about kinds into pre-trained language models. To this end, we source factual knowledge about two types of generics, minority characteristic generics and majority characteristic generics, and inject this knowledge using a knowledge embedding model.

Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model's logical reasoning process. Currently, these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations, and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.",

The effect is particularly significant for low-resourced languages, with a drop as high as 95 points, while even high-resourced languages experience an average drop of 10 points. Our results clearly demonstrate that generalizing inflection to unseen lemmas is still far from being solved and provide a simple yet effective way to encourage the development of more sophisticated models.",

Existing methods for automatic evaluation rely on multiple reference sentences or manual scores, which are expensive and limit the evaluation of various domains and correction styles. To address this issue, this paper presents IMPARA, an Impact-based Metric for GEC using PARAllel data. IMPARA utilizes correction impacts computed from parallel data pairs of grammatical/ungrammatical sentences, which are cheaper to obtain compared to manual evaluation scores. The results show that IMPARA is comparable or better than existing evaluation methods, and it is capable of evaluating different domains and correction styles trained on various parallel data.",

In this work, we argue that current FMS methods are vulnerable, as the assessment mainly relies on the static features extracted from PTMs. However, such features are derived without training PTMs on downstream tasks, and are not necessarily reliable indicators for the PTM's transferability. To validate our viewpoints, we design two methods to evaluate the robustness of FMS: (1) model disguise attack, which post-trains an inferior PTM with a contrastive objective, and (2) evaluation data selection, which selects a subset of the data points for FMS evaluation based on K-means clustering. Experimental results prove that both methods can successfully make FMS mistakenly judge the transferability of PTMs. Moreover, we find that these two methods can further be combined with the backdoor attack to misguide the FMS to select poisoned models.

As for many other generative tasks, reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential to improve the training of MDS models; yet, it requires a carefully-designed reward that can ensure appropriate leverage of both the reference summaries and the input documents. For this reason, in this paper we propose fine-tuning an MDS baseline with a reward that balances a reference-based metric such as ROUGE with coverage of the input documents. To implement the approach, we utilize RELAX (Grathwohl et al., 2018), a contemporary gradient estimator which is both low-variance and unbiased, and we fine-tune the baseline in a few-shot style for both stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results over the Multi-News and WCEP MDS datasets show significant improvements of up to +0.95 pp average ROUGE score and +3.17 pp METEOR score over the baseline, and competitive results with the literature.

Our experiments show that the sentence-wise annotation technique with three overlap labels, i.e., Absent (A), Partially-Present (PP), and Present (P), yields a higher correlation with human judgment and higher inter-rater agreement compared to the ROUGE metric.",

However, due to the costs of pretraining, most research uses public models whose pretraining methodology, such as the choice of tokenization, corpus size, and computational budget, might differ drastically. When researchers pretrain their own models, they often do so under a constrained budget, and the resulting models might underperform significantly compared to SOTA models. These experimental differences led to various inconsistent conclusions about the nature of the cross-lingual ability of these models. To help further research on the topic, we released 10 monolingual byte-level models rigorously pretrained under the same configuration with a large compute budget (equivalent to 420 days on a V100) and corpora that are 4 times larger than the original BERT's. Because they are tokenizer-free, the problem of unseen token embeddings is eliminated, thus allowing researchers to try a wider range of cross-lingual experiments in languages with different scripts. Additionally, we release two models pretrained on non-natural language texts that can be used in sanity-check experiments.

However, recent efforts, such as UNLI and ChaosNLI, have acknowledged and embraced the existence of ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a new approach to training on the estimated label distribution of the annotators in the NLI task, using a learning loss based on the ambiguity distribution instead of the gold-labels. We present AmbiNLI, a trial dataset created from readily available sources, and demonstrate that finetuning on this data can reduce ChaosNLI divergence scores, indicating a promising first step towards capturing linguistic ambiguity. Furthermore, we show that training on the same amount of data but targeting the ambiguity distribution instead of the gold-labels can lead to models with higher performance and better representations for downstream tasks.",

Though such representations are shown to capture hidden syntax structures, the direct similarity comparison between them exhibits weak sensitivity to word order and structural differences in given sentences. A single similarity score further makes the comparison process hard to interpret. Therefore, we here propose to combine sentence encoders with an alignment component by representing each sentence as a list of predicate-argument spans (where their span representations are derived from sentence encoders), and decomposing the sentence-level meaning comparison into the alignment between their spans for paraphrase identification tasks. Empirical results show that the alignment component brings in both improved performance and interpretability for various sentence encoders.

Also, due to the tremendous growth in multilingual content, there is a great demand for building models and systems that support multilingual information access. To end this, we first extend the recently released Multimodal Multiparty Hindi Humor (M2H2) dataset by adding parallel English utterances corresponding to Hindi utterances and then annotating each utterance with sentiment and emotion classes. We name it Sentiment, Humor, and Emotion aware Multilingual Multimodal Multiparty Dataset (SHEMuD). Therefore, we propose a multitask framework wherein the primary task is humor detection, and the auxiliary tasks are sentiment and emotion identification. We design a multitasking framework wherein we first propose a Context Transformer to capture the deep contextual relationships with the input utterances. We then propose a Sentiment and Emotion aware Embedding (SE-Embedding) to get the overall representation of a particular emotion and sentiment w.r.t. the specific humor situation. Experimental results on the SHEMuD show the efficacy of our approach and shows that multitask learning offers an improvement over the single-task framework for both monolingual (4.86 points in Hindi and 5.9 points in English in F1-score) and multilingual (5.17 points in F1-score) setting.",

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the term explanation is overloaded and refers to a broad range of notions with different properties and ramifications. Our goal is to provide an overview of the diversity of explanations, discuss human limitations in providing explanations, and ultimately provide implications for collecting and using human explanations in NLP.Inspired by prior work in psychology and cognitive sciences, we group existing human explanations in NLP into three categories: proximal mechanism, evidence, and procedure. These three types differ in nature and have implications for the resultant explanations. For instance, procedure is not considered explanation in psychology and connects with a rich body of work on learning from instructions. The diversity of explanations is further evidenced by proxy questions that are needed for annotators to interpret and answer “why is [input] assigned [label]”. Finally, giving explanations may require different, often deeper, understandings than predictions, which casts doubt on whether humans can provide valid explanations in some tasks.",

The encoding process includes two graph-based modules that incorporate knowledge graph information into the paper encoding, while the decoding process is divided into two stages: first, generating descriptive sentences that represent the knowledge graph information of the summary, and second, generating the final summary. Our empirical results show that the proposed architecture outperforms existing baselines on the Multi-Xscience dataset.",

State-of-the-art methods usually concentrate on building deep neural networks based classification models on the training data in which the relations of the labeled entity pairs are given. However, these methods usually suffer from the data sparsity issue greatly. On the other hand, we notice that it is very easily to obtain some concise text descriptions for almost all of the entities in a relation classification task. The text descriptions can provide helpful supplementary information for relation classification. But they are ignored by most of existing methods. In this paper, we propose DesRC, a new neural relation classification method which integrates entities' text descriptions into deep neural networks models. We design a two-level attention mechanism to select the most useful information from the “intra-sentence” aspect and the “cross-sentence” aspect. Besides, the adversarial training method is also used to further improve the classification per-formance. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on the SemEval 2010 dataset. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves much better experimental results than other state-of-the-art relation classification methods.",

Given a wide range of topics covering the most important discussion points in social media, we provide training and testing data from recent time periods that can be used to evaluate tweet classification models. Moreover, we perform a quantitative evaluation and analysis of current general- and domain-specific language models on the task, which provide more insights on the challenges and nature of the task.",

To address these two drawbacks, we propose a dynamic graph learning framework and apply it to semantic dependency parsing, for jointly learning graph structure and graph representations.

Existing work mainly focuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without any human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one can achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER with manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data and a large amount of weakly labeled data.

Previous studies have focused on improving the negative sampling strategy or adding extra pretraining to optimize the model. However, these studies have not addressed the issue of capturing passages with internal representation conflicts that arise from improper modeling granularity. Our observation is that passages can be organized into multiple semantically different sentences, and modeling the passage as a unified dense vector is not optimal. To address this issue, we present a refined model based on a smaller granularity, namely contextual sentences, to alleviate the conflicts. We also introduce an in-passage negative sampling strategy to generate diverse sentence representations within the same passage. The effectiveness of our method is verified by experiments on three benchmark datasets, especially on datasets where conflicts are severe. Our method also demonstrates good transferability across datasets in further experiments.",

However, it can be time-consuming for developers to ask programming questions in forums like Stack Overflow and then navigate to actual solutions on GitHub repositories. In this paper, we aim to streamline this process. We find that traditional information retrieval-based methods are not effective in handling long and complex questions in coding forums, making it difficult to find suitable coding repositories. To address this issue, we introduce a specialized dataset, Repo4QA, which includes over 12,000 question-repository pairs obtained from Stack Overflow and GitHub. Additionally, we propose QuRep, a CodeBERT-based model that learns the representation of both questions and repositories simultaneously. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 3-8% on MRR and 5-8% on P@1, as demonstrated by our experimental results. This is achieved by using a supervised contrastive loss and hard negative sampling to capture the semantic features in both questions and repositories.",

As a result, RE still suffers from unintended entity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and relations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that do not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the entity mentions to prevent the RE models from over-fitting entity mentions. However, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the semantic information of entities.

We first construct a causal graph for RE, which models the dependencies between variables in RE models.

Additionally, we use entity-pair-oriented heuristic rules and machine translation to obtain cross-lingual distantly-supervised data, and apply cross-lingual contrastive learning to enhance the PLMs. Our experiments show that our framework can easily learn effective FGET models for low-resource languages, even without any language-specific human-labeled data.

However, due to limited model capacity, the large difference in the sizes of available monolingual corpora between high web-resource languages (HRL) and LRLs does not provide enough scope of co-embedding the LRL with the HRL, thereby affecting the downstream task performance of LRLs. In this paper, we argue that relatedness among languages in a language family along the dimension of lexical overlap may be leveraged to overcome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs. We propose Overlap BPE (OBPE), a simple yet effective modification to the BPE vocabulary generation algorithm which enhances overlap across related languages. Through extensive experiments on multiple NLP tasks and datasets, we observe that OBPE generates a vocabulary that increases the representation of LRLs via tokens shared with HRLs. This results in improved zero-shot transfer from related HRLs to LRLs without reducing HRL representation and accuracy. Unlike previous studies that dismissed the importance of token-overlap, we show that in the low-resource related language setting, token overlap matters. Synthetically reducing the overlap to zero can cause as much as a four-fold drop in zero-shot transfer accuracy.",

        "text": "Pre-trained multilingual language models such as mBERT and XLM-R have shown great promise for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low web-resource languages (LRLs). However, due to their limited capacity, the large difference in the size of available monolingual corpora between high web-resource languages (HRLs) and LRLs makes it difficult to co-embed LRLs with HRLs, which negatively impacts the performance of LRLs in downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose that the relatedness of languages within a language family, as measured by lexical overlap, can be leveraged to overcome some of the limitations of LRLs. We present Overlap BPE (OBPE), a simple modification to the BPE vocabulary generation algorithm that enhances overlap across related languages. Our extensive experiments on various NLP tasks and datasets show that OBPE generates a vocabulary that increases the representation of LRLs through tokens shared with HRLs, resulting in improved zero-shot transfer from related HRLs to LRLs without sacrificing HRL representation or accuracy. Unlike previous studies that downplayed the importance of token overlap, we demonstrate that, in the low-resource related language setting, token overlap is crucial.

For the task of short-text classification, a model containing 28 best-features (selected via Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation; RFECV) confers an accuracy jump of 15.56 % over a baseline model consisting of 2 POS-ratio features found effective in previous work (cited above). The efficacy of the above model containing a linguistically motivated feature set also transfers over to another dataset viz, Baby BNC corpus. We also compared the classification accuracy of the logistic regression model with two deep-learning models. A 1D CNN model gives an increase of 2% accuracy over the logistic Regression classifier on both corpora. And the BERT-base-uncased model gives the best classification accuracy of 97% on Brown corpus and 98% on Baby BNC corpus. Although both the deep learning models give better results in terms of classification accuracy, the problem of interpreting these models remains unsolved. In contrast, regression model coefficients revealed that fiction texts tend to have more character-level diversity and have lower lexical density (quantified using content-function word ratios) compared to non-fiction texts. Moreover, subtle differences in word order exist between the two genres, i.e., in fiction texts Verbs precede Adverbs (inter-alia).",

The model infers lexical and syntactic properties that differentiate the two genres. Unlike previous studies that focused on classifying document-level text, this work deals with shorter texts, which are more relevant to real-world applications such as sentiment analysis of tweets. Instead of relying on simple POS tag ratios, as proposed in Qureshi et al. (2019), this work extracts multiple linguistically motivated features from four categories: lexical features, POS ratio features, syntactic features, and raw features. The best-performing model, selected via Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), contains 28 features and outperforms the baseline model by 15.56% accuracy. The logistic regression model also transfers well to another dataset, the Baby BNC corpus. The model's performance is compared to two deep-learning models: a 1D CNN model and a BERT-base-uncased model. The deep-learning models achieve higher accuracy, but the problem of interpretation remains unresolved.

We use Doc2Vec on a corpus of 16.8M anonymous online posts in the German-speaking area to learn continuous document representations of cities. These representations capture continuous regional linguistic distinctions, and can serve as input to downstream NLP tasks sensitive to regional variation. By incorporating geographic information via retrofitting and agglomerative clustering with structure, we recover dialect areas at various levels of granularity. Evaluating these clusters against an existing dialect map, we achieve a match of up to 0.77 V-score (harmonic mean of cluster completeness and homogeneity). Our results show that representation learning with retrofitting offers a robust general method to automatically expose dialectal differences and regional variation at a finer granularity than was previously possible.",

Since their manual construction is resource- and time-intensive, recent efforts have tried leveraging large pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate additional monolingual knowledge facts for KBs. However, such methods have not been attempted for building and enriching multilingual KBs. Besides wider application, such multilingual KBs can provide richer combined knowledge than monolingual (e.g., English) KBs. Knowledge expressed in different languages may be complementary and unequally distributed: this implies that the knowledge available in high-resource languages can be transferred to low-resource ones. To achieve this, it is crucial to represent multilingual knowledge in a shared/unified space. To this end, we propose a unified representation model, Prix-LM, for multilingual KB construction and completion. We leverage two types of knowledge, monolingual triples and cross-lingual links, extracted from existing multilingual KBs, and tune a multilingual language encoder XLM-R via a causal language modeling objective.

However, SLU corpora consist of plenty of semantic labels (slots), which general-purpose translators cannot handle well, not to mention additional culture differences. This paper focuses on the language transferring task given a small in-domain parallel SLU corpus. The in-domain parallel corpus can be used as the first adaptation on the general translator.

In this study, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning approach for paraphrase generation. Our framework incorporates a generator and an evaluator, both of which are learned from data. The generator, designed as a sequence-to-sequence learning model, generates paraphrases from a sentence. The evaluator, constructed as a deep matching model, determines whether two sentences are paraphrases of each other. The generator is initially trained through deep learning, then further refined through reinforcement learning, with rewards provided by the evaluator. We propose two methods for learning the evaluator: one based on supervised learning and the other on inverse reinforcement learning, depending on the type of training data available. Our experiments on two datasets show that our proposed models (the generators) produce more accurate paraphrases and outperform current state-of-the-art methods in paraphrase generation, as demonstrated by both automatic evaluations and human evaluations.",

Conventional methods for DECI construct an event graph by using heuristic rules or external tools to carefully design the edges between events. However, this process can be prone to errors. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Event Relational Graph Transformer (ERGO) to simplify the graph construction and address the issue of noisy edges. Unlike traditional event graphs, ERGO defines a pair of events as a node, and builds a complete event relational graph without relying on any prior knowledge or tools. This approach turns DECI into a node classification problem, allowing us to capture the transitivity of causation among event pairs through a graph transformer. Additionally, we implement a criss-cross constraint and an adaptive focal loss to address the imbalanced classification problem and reduce false positives and false negatives. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that ERGO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by an average of 12.8% in terms of F1 score.",

However, previous JointIE models often assume heuristic manually-designed dependency between the task instances and mean-field factorization for the joint distribution of instance labels, thus unable to capture optimal dependencies among instances and labels to improve representation learning and IE performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose to induce a dependency graph among task instances from data to boost representation learning. To better capture dependencies between instance labels, we propose to directly estimate their joint distribution via Conditional Random Fields. Noise Contrastive Estimation is introduced to address the maximization of the intractable joint likelihood for model training.

Individual networks are often slow in reporting attacks, so a detection system from public data could better assist a response to a broad attack across multiple services. We explore NLP methods to use social media as an indirect measure of network service status. We describe two learning frameworks for this task: a feed-forward neural network and a partially labeled LDA model. Both models outperform previous work by significant margins (20% F1 score). We further show that the topic-based model enables the first fine-grained analysis of how the public reacts to ongoing network attacks, discovering multiple “stages” of observation. This is the first model that both detects network attacks (with best performance) and provides an analysis of when and how the public interprets service outages. We describe the models, present experiments on the largest twitter DDoS corpus to date, and conclude with an analysis of public reactions based on the learned model's output.",

While existing works perform well on high-frequency charges, they struggle with predicting few-shot charges with limited cases. Additionally, there are many confusing charge pairs with similar fact descriptions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce discriminative attributes of charges as the internal mapping between fact descriptions and charges. These attributes provide additional information for few-shot charges and help differentiate confusing charges. We propose an attribute-attentive charge prediction model that simultaneously infers the attributes and charges. Our experiments on real-world datasets show significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 50% improvement in the few-shot scenario.

Moreover, we found that multi-span answers often appear with two characteristics when building the QA system for a real-world application. First, multi-span answers might be caused by users lacking domain knowledge and asking ambiguous questions, which makes the question need to be answered with conditions. Second, there might be hierarchical relations among multiple answer spans. Some recent span-extraction QA datasets include multi-span samples, but they only contain unconditional and parallel answers, which cannot be used to tackle this problem. To bridge the gap, we propose a new task: conditional question answering with hierarchical multi-span answers, where both the hierarchical relations and the conditions need to be extracted. Correspondingly, we introduce CMQA, a Conditional Multiple-span Chinese Question Answering dataset to study the new proposed task. The final release of CMQA consists of 7,861 QA pairs and 113,089 labels, where all samples contain multi-span answers, 50.4% of samples are conditional, and 56.6% of samples are hierarchical.

        "text": "The restriction of forcing the answer of a Question Answering (QA) task to be a single text span may not be feasible since the answer can consist of multiple spans in the context. Our research found that multi-span answers often have two characteristics when building a QA system for real-world applications. Firstly, multi-span answers can result from users lacking domain knowledge and asking ambiguous questions, requiring answers with conditions. Secondly, there may be hierarchical relationships among multiple answer spans. Although some recent span-extraction QA datasets include multi-span samples, they only contain unconditional and parallel answers, which are not suitable for addressing this issue. To address this gap, we propose a new task: Conditional Question Answering with Hierarchical Multi-span Answers, where both the hierarchical relationships and conditions need to be extracted. To support this task, we introduce CMQA, a Conditional Multiple-span Chinese Question Answering dataset, which includes 7,861 QA pairs and 113,089 labels. All samples in CMQA contain multi-span answers, with 50.4% being conditional and 56.6% having hierarchical relationships. CMQA serves as a benchmark for the new task and can help in building QA systems for real-world applications. The low performance of models from related literature highlights the challenge of the new task for the community to solve.",

In this work, we build on recent progress in applying pre-training to this co-extraction task with the introduction of an adaptation of Unsupervised Data Augmentation in semi-supervised learning. As originally implemented, UDA cannot accommodate span-level classification since it relies on advanced data augmentation techniques, such as back-translation, that alter the sequence lengths of the original data and cause index mismatches. We introduce an adaptation of UDA using Masked Language Model (MLM) unmasking that accommodates this index-match constraint and test the approach on standard ABSA benchmark datasets.

However, the computational complexity of a self-attention network is C-C-C, increasing quadratically with sequence length. By contrast, the complexity of LSTM-based approaches is only O(n). In practice, however, LSTMs are much slower to train than self-attention networks as they cannot be parallelized at sequence level: to model context, the current LSTM state relies on the full LSTM computation of the preceding state. This has to be computed n times for a sequence of length n. The linear transformations involved in the LSTM gate and state computations are the major cost factors in this. To enable sequence-level parallelization of LSTMs, we approximate full LSTM context modelling by computing hidden states and gates with the current input and a simple bag-of-words representation of the preceding tokens context. This allows us to compute each input step efficiently in parallel, avoiding the formerly costly sequential linear transformations. We then connect the outputs of each parallel step with computationally cheap element-wise computations. We call this the Highly Parallelized LSTM. To further constrain the number of LSTM parameters, we compute several small HPLSTMs in parallel like multi-head attention in the Transformer.

Here, we present a data collection strategy for MT which, in contrast, is cheap and simple, as it does not require bilingual speakers. Based on the insight that humans pay specific attention to movements, we use graphics interchange formats (GIFs) as a pivot to collect parallel sentences from monolingual annotators. We use our strategy to collect data in Hindi, Tamil and English. As a baseline, we also collect data using images as a pivot. We perform an intrinsic evaluation by manually evaluating a subset of the sentence pairs and an extrinsic evaluation by finetuning mBART (Liu et al., 2020) on the collected data. We find that sentences collected via GIFs are indeed of higher quality.",

        "text": "Unsupervised commonsense question answering is appealing since it does not rely on any labeled task data. Among existing work, a popular solution is to use pre-trained language models to score candidate choices directly conditioned on the question or context. However, such scores from language models can be easily affected by irrelevant factors, such as word frequencies, sentence structures, etc. These distracting factors may not only mislead the model to choose a wrong answer but also make it oversensitive to lexical perturbations in candidate answers. In this paper, we present a novel SEmantic-based Question Answering method (SEQA) for unsupervised commonsense question answering. Instead of directly scoring each answer choice, our method first generates a set of plausible answers with generative models (e.g., GPT-2), and then uses these plausible answers to select the correct choice by considering the semantic similarity between each plausible answer and each choice. We devise a simple, yet sound formalism for this idea and verify its effectiveness and robustness with extensive experiments. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmark datasets, and our method achieves the best results in unsupervised settings. Moreover, when attacked by TextFooler with synonym replacement, SEQA demonstrates much less performance drops than baselines, thereby indicating stronger robustness.",

In this work, we present continuous decomposition of granularity for neural paraphrase generation (C-DNPG): an advanced extension of multi-head self-attention with: 1) a granularity head that automatically infers the hierarchical structure of a sentence by neurally estimating the granularity level of each input token; and 2) two novel attention masks, namely, granularity resonance and granularity scope, to efficiently encode granularity into attention. Experiments on two benchmarks, including Quora question pairs and Twitter URLs have shown that C-DNPG outperforms baseline models by a significant margin.

To defend against this attack that can cause significant harm, in this paper, we borrow the “honeypot” concept from the cybersecurity community and propose DARCY, a honeypot-based defense framework against UniTrigger. DARCY greedily searches and injects multiple trapdoors into an NN model to “bait and catch” potential attacks. Through comprehensive experiments across four public datasets, we show that DARCY detects UniTrigger's adversarial attacks with up to 99% TPR and less than 2% FPR in most cases, while maintaining the prediction accuracy (in F1) for clean inputs within a 1% margin. We also demonstrate that DARCY with multiple trapdoors is also robust to a diverse set of attack scenarios with attackers' varying levels of knowledge and skills.
